# SYNQ
Android App for Qortal

SYNQ (v0.0.1 beta)

SYNQ allows you to view and monitor multiple accounts from your Android device, it is also possible to add accounts to watchlists and setup notifications for accounts on those watchlists. Currently only notifications pertaining to minting activity are available, such as periodically receiving minting reports for one selected account. Notifications for when a mintint account on your watchlist has stalled and when it resumes minting are also offered. 

The app can collect minting data for all added minting accounts with increased minting data collection for accounts on your selected watchlist if you have notifications enabled in the background.

In the future more notifications and actions should become available.
